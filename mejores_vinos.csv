8869,Argentina,"If you love massive Argentine reds with purity of fruit and fine oak, then this blend is up your alley. Toasty blackberry aromas come with plenty of oak grain, vanilla and depth. This is profoundly deep on the palate, while toasty blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors finish with mocha and bracing tannins that aren't too rocky or hard. Drink through 2025.",Finca Pedregal Single Vineyard Barrancas Maipú Selected Lots,95,74.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Pascual Toso 2014 Finca Pedregal Single Vineyard Barrancas Maipú Selected Lots Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza),Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec,Pascual Toso,América del Sur,Alto
38984,Argentina,"This is a supreme small-lot Argentine wine from lauded winemaker Jorge Riccitelli. The blend is 70% Malbec with 20% Cabernet and 10% Merlot. Aromas of loam, wild berry and vanilla are elegant and exciting. This is silky smooth, with creamy oak and ripe black-fruit flavors playing together through a mellow, plush finish. Drink this impressive, complete Malbec blend through 2016.",Vineyard Selection,95,62.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Finca Perdriel 2007 Vineyard Selection Red (Mendoza),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Finca Perdriel,América del Sur,Alto
7335,Italy,"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”",Occhio di Pernice,100,210.0,Tuscany,Vin Santo di Montepulciano,,,,Avignonesi 1995 Occhio di Pernice  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano),Prugnolo Gentile,Avignonesi,Europa,Alto
36528,France,"This is a fabulous wine from the greatest Champagne vintage so far this century. Still young, it blends almost equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay fleshed out with Pinot Meunier. The minerality and the rich apple and green fruits are balanced, and acidity cuts into the wine with a pure, perfumed line of freshness. The wine could be drunk now, but it will age well into the the 2020s.",Brut,100,259.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Krug 2002 Brut  (Champagne),Champagne Blend,Krug,Europa,Alto
39286,Italy,"A perfect wine from a classic vintage, the 2007 Masseto (100% Merlot from a 17-acre vineyard of the same name) opens with an unabashedly opulent bouquet of delicious blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, exotic spice and cinnamon. Masseto excels both in terms of quality of fruit and winemaking and delivers plush, velvety tannins and an extra long, supple finish. It will make a special and valuable collection to your cellar.",Masseto,100,460.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2007 Masseto Merlot (Toscana),Merlot,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia,Europa,Alto
45781,Italy,"This gorgeous, fragrant wine opens with classic Sangiovese scents of violet, rose, perfumed red berry, new leather and a whiff of baking spice. The elegant, radiant palate delivers crushed Marasca cherry, ripe strawberry, cinnamon, black tea and a hint of pipe tobacco. Firm, ultrafine tannins and bright acidity offer an age-worthy structure and impeccable balance. It's already stunning but will evolve for decades. Drink 2020–2050.",Riserva,100,550.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Biondi Santi 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Sangiovese,Biondi Santi,Europa,Alto
58352,France,"This is a magnificently solid wine, initially even a bit severe. At this young stage, the tannins dominate, but it's also full of black fruit notes. Very dense and concentrated, this is a wine that's even better than the legendary 2005. The structure tells of its extraordinary aging potential: don't even attempt to drink this for 10 years.",,100,150.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Château Léoville Barton 2010  Saint-Julien,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Barton,Europa,Alto
345,Australia,"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",Rare,100,350.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),Muscat,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,Otros,Alto
42197,Portugal,This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,Barca-Velha,100,450.0,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha,Otros,Alto
45798,US,"Tasted in a flight of great and famous Napa wines, this Cardinale stood at the head of the pack. Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Oakville, and the blend contains 14% Merlot. As good as it is now, it will improve for at least eight years.",,100,200.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Cardinale 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Cardinale,Otros,Alto
